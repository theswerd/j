# J Lang Design

J Lang is designed with 3 key principals:

1. **Enforced Security**: J Lang is designed to enforce security. All variables are homorphically encrypted at all times. It is **not falsey**, and it will make no assumptions about types or traits that are not directly written.

2. **Extensible**: J Lang is made to interact with other packages and languages. Everything in J Lang is extensible, allowing easy additions to packages and adding scalability to programs.

3. **IDE Optimization**: J Lang is designed to be written in an IDE. J Lang syntax is designed to work well with autocomplete in order to allow both readability and agility in development.
