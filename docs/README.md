# J Lang

**In Early Dev/Research Phase**

### Overview

J Lang is an **ultra secure** programming language. All J Lang variables are homorphically encrypted so they are unreadable at runtime. 

#### Why
- This allows for developers to process private data on untrusted servers as the data will stay encrypted through the calculations. 

- Even is a server is compromised, the data on it will be unreadable to the hacker.

### Language Design

J Lang syntax is heavily inspired by **Dart** and **Rust**, with a little bit of **Java**.
